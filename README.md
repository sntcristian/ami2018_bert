# bert_ami
This is a Bert Model trained with pytorch for the task of Automatic Misoginy Identification in tweets.
For this model we performed fine-tuning on AlBERTo, a pretrained lower-case model based on a italian vocabulary extracted from social media, that we fed with a dataset of 1000 tweets.
The model reached an 88% of accuracy without any hyper-parameter tuning.
